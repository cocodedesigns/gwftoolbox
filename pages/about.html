  <p>Hi, I’m Nathan Hawkes — a designer, developer, and creative technologist who loves building thoughtful, user-focused digital experiences. I work across both design and code, bringing ideas to life through clean interfaces, responsive layouts, and purposeful functionality.</p>

  <p>I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from custom WordPress themes to web apps and design systems. Whether I’m crafting a font site, managing a complex plugin, or sketching out a new UI, my focus is always on usability, performance, and maintaining a sense of polish throughout the work.</p>

  <p>This site is a collection of my personal projects and experiments — a space to explore, share, and build without boundaries. Thanks for visiting!</p>
