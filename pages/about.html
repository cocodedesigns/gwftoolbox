    <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello there! I'm Nathan Hawkes - a designer, developer, and creative technologist who loves building thoughtful, user-focused digital experiences. I specialise in developing websites with WordPress, but I also enjoy crafting custom PHP and HTML-based projects, such as <a href="https://colourlibrary.dev/" target="_blank">Colour Library</a> or <a href="https://whobrokethenews.net/" target="_blank">Who Broke The News?</a>. I work fluidly across design and code, bringing ideas to life through clean interfaces, responsive layouts, and purposeful functionality.</p>

    <p>I've been working as a developer in various capacities since 2007, and I became fully self-employed in 2016, creating websites for small businesses, nonprofits, and new startups. With a background in education, I've delivered workshops on everything from <em>Basic Computing</em> to <em>Managing Your WordPress Website</em>. I also have nearly two decades of experience in the nonprofit sector, where I've helped organisations communicate better through well-designed digital tools and platforms.</p>

    <p>You can see some of the work I've done over the years by visiting my portfolio at <a href="https://nathanhawkes.dev/" target="_blank">nathanhawkes.dev</a>. You can read some of my blog posts, find out how to get in touch, or even help support some of these projects. Perhaps you might consider <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/nathanhawkes" target="_blank">buyng me a coffee</a>? Just a thought ...</p>

    <p>Outside of development work, I love writing fiction and occasionally lose myself in the realms of science fiction and fantasy. I'm especially drawn to projects that explore new worlds - whether that's through storytelling, speculative technology, or innovative design. I have a passion for gameplay, especially tabletop role playing games such as <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> (although I have yet to actually play a game, so hit me up if you want to add a newbie to your group).</p>

    <p>If you'd like to chat, collaborate, or learn more about what I do, feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:nathan@nathanhawkes.dev">nathan@nathanhawkes.dev</a>. It'd be great to hear from you.</p>
