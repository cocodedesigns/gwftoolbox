    <h1 class="page-title">About GWF Toolbox</h1>

    <p><strong>Google Webfont Toolbox</strong> is a lightweight browser-based tool for previewing and refining Google Fonts before you use them in a project. It allows you to test font styles, and quickly grab the embed code or CSS needed to integrate your chosen fonts into a design.</p>

    <p>It takes inspiration from the work of the <a href="https://gwfh.mranftl.com/" target="_blank">Google Webfont Helper</a>, creating a better designed system that allows you to see more information about the fonts in question. While the original project allowed you to download font files to self-host, this Tolbox goes a little further:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You can find out more data about the typefaces, including designer copyright and licensing information.</li>
        <li>You can get a clearer indication of whether your chosen font is going to work by previewing all of the variants.</li>
        <li>You can check whether your chosen font will work with your theme colours - and test them against WCAG AA and AAA standards</li>
        <li>You can view the suitability of your chosen font for a design project, with x-height and cap height measurements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fonts are loaded directly from the Google Fonts API, so you'll always be working with the latest available styles. You can also download TTF versions of the fonts (WOFF2 coming ... soon? Hopefully?)</p>

    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
    
    <p>This project is built using a mix of lightweight, modern web technologies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> for structure and design</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong> for interactivity and DOM manipulation</li>
        <li><strong>Google Fonts API</strong> to pull font data and previews live</li>
        <li><strong>LocalStorage</strong> to remember user preferences between visits</li>
        <li><strong>Font Awesome</strong> for all of the pretty, awesome, and pretty awesome icons</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It also utilises these amazing scripts, without which we couldn't have built most of the features here:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prism.js</strong> for previewing the code</li>
        <li><strong>JSZip</strong> for saving your chosen fonts into a ZIP file</li>
        <li><strong>Filesaver.js</strong> for help writing and saving downloaded files to your system</li>
        <li><strong>opentype.js</strong> for help analysing font data, including typeface anatomy</li>
    </ul>
