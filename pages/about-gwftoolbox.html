<div class="page-wrap about-gwftoolbox-page">
  <p><strong>GWF Toolbox</strong> is a lightweight browser-based tool for previewing and refining Google Fonts before you use them in a project. It allows you to test font pairings, customise type styles, and quickly grab the embed code or CSS needed to integrate your chosen fonts into a design.</p>

  <p>The preview area supports live editing of text and lets you control size, weight, and colour. You can also toggle between light, dark, and auto themes, helping you visualise how fonts perform in different environments. The interface is built to be simple, fast, and accessible across devices.</p>

  <p>Fonts are loaded directly from the Google Fonts API, so you’ll always be working with the latest available styles. Any changes you make can be saved locally using browser storage, making it easy to return to your favourite combinations later. No accounts, no tracking — just a focused tool for better typography.</p>

  <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
  <p>This project is built using a mix of lightweight, modern web technologies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> for structure and design</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong> for interactivity and DOM manipulation</li>
    <li><strong>PHP</strong> for server-side tasks (like setting theme preferences)</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts API</strong> to pull font data and previews live</li>
    <li><strong>LocalStorage</strong> to remember user preferences between visits</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The site is fully static apart from minor PHP interaction, and all performance-critical features run client-side to ensure a fast, responsive experience.</p>
